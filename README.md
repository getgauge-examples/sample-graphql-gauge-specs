## GraphQL API testing with Gauge

**Disclaimer**: My intention is only to demonstrate how can we write GraphQL API tests using 
Gauge + Gauge-Js + graphql-request. Please do not consider this as an exaple for how to implement GraphQL API.


### Prerequisites.
--------------------
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org)
- [Gauge](https://gauge.org/). Click [here](https://gauge.org/getting-started-guide/quick-install) if you don't have Gauge installed on your system.
- [Gauge-Js](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-js/blob/master/README.md) plugin

### How to run gauge specs in this example.

--------------------
- Navigate to `graphql-server` directory
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `gauge-specs` directory
- Run `gauge specs` or `npm test`
